# Population-Unemployment-Poverty-Education

I was interested to explore ratios between unemployment, education, poverty and adult (+17) population in the United States. 

I had a hypothesis that education level and poverty percentage per state have a negative relationship, meaning that the more educated people there are in the state the less poverty percentage. I also wanted to see what are the poorest states and which states have the highest unemployment rate.

In this project I extensively used data wranlging, tidying, joining, manipulating, and feature engineering.

This plot below shows the scatter plot relationship between percentage of adults in poverty and unemployment rate in the year of 2019. One can see that the poorest states are Mississippi, Louisiana, New Mexico, and West Virginia, while the highest unemployment rate is in Alaska,but has a significantly lower percent of people in poverty when compared to the states that were mentioned before. This plot shows a positive relationship between poverty percentage and unemployment rate, with one exception and that is Alaska.

I then started to explore the relationship between percent of adults in poverty and percent of adults with a bachelor’s degree. My hypothesis was that the relationship would be a negative one, and looking at this graph shows that the level of higher education is indeed anti-proportional to the percentage of poverty.

Key points are highlighted with the orange color. The poorest states that are shown to have the lowest percentage of adults with a bachelor’s degree are Mississippi and West Virginia, while New Mexico seems to have a higher percentage of adults with university degree but still has high percentage of adutls in poverty. The highest percentage of higher education belongs to Massachusetts, Colorado, and Maryland. And the lowest percentage of adults in poverty belongs to New Hampshire. I should note that poverty percentage was recorded in 2019 and education level was recorded between year 2014-2018.

This last figure describes the poverty percentage by state in 2019. The geospatial description conveys a clearer information about the poverty percentages, and as one can see the “darkest” state is Mississippi followed by Louisiana and New Mexico. This map shows that poverty percentage is highest in the South-East of United States when compared to both coasts and middle of United States. I should note that Puerto Rico is not shown on this graphic, and that’s due to no recorded values for that state from the data set I used.
